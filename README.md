# gResistor3

To allow for identification, resistors are usually marked
with colored bands. Often refered to as color codes, these
markings are indicative of their resistance, tolerance and
temperature coefficient. gResistor helps you translate
resistor color codes into a readable value. All you have to
do is watch the colors on the resistor and then enter them
in the program. As you enter colours you'll see that the
resistor value is changing accordingly.
